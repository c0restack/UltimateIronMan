# UltimateIronMan
A minecraft server plugin that tracks which players have not died on the server. Players who have died have their max health reduced according to the number of deaths.

Since I don't expect anyone else to use this I just made to work with my raspberry pi so some modification is required if you want to also use this plugin.
At least "String polku = "/home/pi/minecraft/plugins/";" in UltimateIronManPlugin.java should be changed to the path of your server directory.
Also the chat messages are in finnish.

If you someone want's to get this to work on their server just shoot me a message and i'll be happy to update it.
